# Cross-Agent Orchestration

## Event Flow (GitHub-Native)

The entire orchestration runs through GitHub's native event system — no custom event bus needed:

```
Human creates issue with label "idea"
  → GitHub Action triggers Deep Research (High-Reasoning Model)
  → Deep Research completes → adds label "researched"
  → GitHub Action triggers Roadmap Planning (High-Reasoning Model)
  → Planning creates Project board + sub-issues → adds label "planned"
  → Human reviews, approves → adds label "approved"
  → GitHub Action assigns issues to Dev Agents (Production/Utility)
  → Dev agent creates PR → triggers Code Review Action
  → Review approved → triggers QA matrix
  → QA passes → adds label "qa-passed"
  → All milestone items "qa-passed" → triggers Release Agent
  → Human approves release → publish pipeline runs
```

## Label-Based State Machine

```
idea → researched → planned → approved → in-progress → review → qa-passed → released
                                  ↑                        │
                                  └── rejected (with ctx) ──┘
```

## Project Memory

Stored as `.github/project-memory.json` in the repository — version-controlled with full history:

```json
{
  "current_version": "0.1.0",
  "supported_versions": ["0.1.x"],
  "pending_deprecations": [],
  "roadmap": {
    "next_milestone": "v0.2.0",
    "planned_features": ["Plugin system", "Async support"],
    "tech_debt_items": 3
  },
  "agent_performance": {
    "jules_success_rate": 0.85,
    "avg_review_iterations": 1.3,
    "avg_task_completion_hours": 2.1
  },
  "community": {
    "contributors": 0,
    "open_issues": 12,
    "weekly_downloads": 0
  }
}
```

All agents read from and write to this file. It's version-controlled, so you have full history of project state evolution.
