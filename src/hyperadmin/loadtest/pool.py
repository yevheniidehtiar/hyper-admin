"""Foreign-key ID pool with Pareto-skewed sampling.

A real ERP is *skewed*: a handful of "hot" accounts own most of the invoices. Benchmarks run
against uniform-random FK references understate index-seek cost and cache pressure, so the
pool draws parent IDs with an ≈80/20 Pareto skew instead of uniformly.

Sampling uses the inverse-transform of a bounded power law over the *rank* of parent IDs. If a
parent list has ``n`` entries ranked ``0..n-1`` (insertion order), the probability that a draw
lands in the top fraction ``f`` of ranks is ``f ** ((a-1)/a)``. For ``a = 1.16`` that makes the
top 20% of parents own ≈80% of references — the documented skew — with no clamping artefacts.

``numpy`` is a *soft* dependency used to vectorise :meth:`FKPool.sample_many`; without it the
pool falls back to a pure-stdlib loop over :func:`random.Random.random`. Both paths are
reproducible under a fixed seed; they are not required to produce byte-identical streams.
