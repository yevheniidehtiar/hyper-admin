## Overview
Locust-based load testing suite with docker-compose (PostgreSQL + app + workers), baseline recording, regression detection, and CI integration.

## Sub-issues
- #257 chore(deps): add locust and rich to dev dependencies
- #258 feat(loadtest): docker-compose.loadtest.yml
- #259 feat(loadtest): auth session mixin for Locust
- #260 test: unit tests for task weights and URL generation
- #261 feat(loadtest): Locust read endpoint user classes
- #262 feat(loadtest): Locust CRUD write user class
- #263 feat(loadtest): baseline recording and regression comparison
- #264 feat(loadtest): update ERP Dockerfile for PostgreSQL
- #265 ci: GitHub Actions workflow (smoke + nightly)

## Endpoint coverage
| Endpoint | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| List view + pagination | 40% |
| Search | 15% |
| Sort | 10% |
| Detail view | 15% |
| FK choices | 10% |
| Create | 5% |
| Update | 3% |
| Delete | 2% |

## Regression thresholds
- p95 > 2× baseline = failure
- Error rate > 1% = failure
